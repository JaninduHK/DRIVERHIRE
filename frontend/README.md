# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Google Analytics (GA4)

1. Create a GA4 property and copy its Measurement ID (format `G-XXXXXXXX`).
2. Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file based on `.env.example` and set `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=<your-id>`.
3. Restart the Vite dev server so the new environment variable is picked up.

The app now injects the Google tag automatically on startup and records a page view on every route change handled by React Router. When the measurement ID is missing, a warning is logged in development but the rest of the app keeps working.
